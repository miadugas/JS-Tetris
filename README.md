# JS-Tetris

Tetris
Tetris was created in 1984 by Alexey Pajitnov. The game requires players to rotate and move falling Tetris pieces. Players clear lines by completing horizontal rows of blocks without empty cells. But, if the pieces reach the top, the game is over.

Some of the concepts used in building this were: graphics, game loops, and collision detection. 
This is a fully functioning game with points and levels.
